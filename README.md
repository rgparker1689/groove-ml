# Groove ML
This repo contains an assortment of projects dealing with drum grooves, their segmentation, their classification, and more. The goal is to work these into a tool useful for drummers to analyze their playing in an era where more and more percussion is being programmed with software.

## Groove ID
This is my work training a model to predict whether a supplied .wav file containing a groove was produced by a musician playing drums or programmed via MIDI or some VST plugin.

## Hit ID
This is my work developing scripts and models to separate hits and classify them as certain types of drums or cymbals.
