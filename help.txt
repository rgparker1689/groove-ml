 helpful stuff

basic knowledge
    the machine learning works by looking at large amounts of data for a specific case (i.e. audio file) and making a prediction about it, then retraining to compensate for mistakes
    we choose what data is fed into it, obviously has to be relevant data that could help model predict programmed or performed
    right now i am using 
        1) tempograms, which are graphs of the local autocorrelation at each sample-- To get in same format as below (global) i am averaging them
        2) global autocorrelation of file (this seems to have a good bit of promise, you saw the image I posted, pretty clear differences between performed and programmed here)

1. Collect audio training data
    Stick to shorter files, currently only processing first 4 seconds, wavs
    Isolated Drums, programmed or performed, but keep programmed relatively acoustic sounding
    Well performed is better, segments of famous drum tracks isolated
    **If you upload a file to drive put name of file in train_test_files.csv following format (programmed on left column, performed on right, sep by comma)
    
2. Research/use knowledge of audio files and processing
    The tempogram/global autocorrelations are two features, but there could be and probably are lots more that are more useful
    thinking about different ways that we would tell apart programmed and performed files by listening, and doing this at a much smaller and more detailed level
    I've been thinking along lines of somehow quantifying the difference in tones when a specific drum or cymbal is hit (since we hit them slightly differently each time)

3. Learn python
    you can get to know the groove-ml.py file which will be the main code, i can explain (mostly) everything in it if you need

4. Research useful Keras layers
    layers are the ways the data is manipulated each time it is trained. they can be weighted to skew the way the model approaches the data which is how it improves
    **Specifically for audio analysis in tensorflow
